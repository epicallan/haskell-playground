    How do Traversals fit into the lens hierarchy?

    All Lenses are usable as Traversals over a single element
    All traversals are also Folds
    Most traversals are Indexable and can contain location info. E.g. index in their list, key of a Map

-- type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f => (a -> f b) -> s -> f t

{-
    s: Starting structure, e.g. [Transaction] in our case
    t: Ending structure, e.g. [result]
    a: Starting focus, e.g. Transaction
    b: Ending focus, e.g. result

{-
Let's say we have a list of Transactions and we want to focus
on each element of that list using a traversal.

{-
 Assumming we have lenses over Banck account
 i.e
 transactions :: Lens' BankAccount [Transaction]
 we can compose and dervive accountWithdrawlas

    accountWithdrawals :: Traversal' BankAccount Int
    accountWithdrawals = transactions . withdrawals
