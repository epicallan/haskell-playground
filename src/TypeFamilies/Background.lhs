TypeFamilies background

Essentially, type families allow us to write functions on types.

````
  data Z
  data S n

  type family Plus m n :: *
  type instance Plus Z n = n
  type instance Plus (S m) n = S (Plus m n)
```

This says that for any types m and n, Plus m n is type of kind *. 
But it isn’t a new type, it’s just an alias for some existing type

It’s instructive to think carefully about the difference between this and type synonyms

We can define some type foo as below

``` type Foo m n = [(m, Maybe n)] ````

which defines the type synonym Foo uniformly for all arguments m and n, but using only type synonyms we cannot say

```
  type Foo m Int = [m]
  type Foo m Char = Maybe m
````


Total type families
__________________

A type family whose equations cover all the possible cases and which is guaranteed to terminate. 
That is, a total type family is properly a function on types. 


Non-covering type families
______________________________________

A non-covering type family is a type family whose patterns do not cover the whole space. 
Let’s consider closed and open families separately.

A closed type Family 

> type family F1 a where
>   F1 Int = Bool

> sillyId :: F1 Char -> F1 Char
> sillyId x = x

Open type families

> type family F2 a
> type instance F2 Int = Bool
