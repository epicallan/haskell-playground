-- | In dependently typed languages a universe consists of a type of
-- of codes together with an interpretation function mapping codes to
-- types. The idea of the SOP universe is that the kinds of codes is a promoted
-- list of types. The universe is represented as the Code type family
-- The goal of Code type family is to map a data type to its "code"

type family Code (a :: Type) :: [[Type]]

-- Example of mapping Expr to its codes
data Expr = Num Int | Add { _left :: Expr , _right :: Expr }

type instance Code Expr = '[ '[Int], '[Expr, Expr]]
-- | The outer list has one element per constructor. For each constructor the corresponding
-- inner list contains the types of the constructor argument

-- | the SOP (sum of products) interpretation of the codes of kind [[Type]] views the outer list
-- as an n-ary sum, representing the choice between the constructors and the
-- inner lists as a n-ary products

newtype I (a :: Type) = I { unI :: a}
newtype K (a :: Type) (b :: k) = K { unK :: a}

-- | SOP I (Code a) is isomorphic to the original datatype a.
-- This isomorphism is captured by the type class Generic

type Rep a = SOP I (Code a) -- SOP is defined below

-- actual definition is SingI (Code a) => Generic (a :: Type) where...
class Generic (a :: Type) where
  from :: a -> Rep a
  to   :: Rep a -> a

-- | If we can define a function that works for all codes then we can turn
-- that function into a data type generic function by making it work on all
-- suitable instances of class Generic

-- | POP f (for products of products) views both the outer and inner type level lists
-- as n-ary products and applies f to all the elements.

-- | In order to translate Haskell values into the SOP universe
-- we need support for n-ary sums and products

data NP' :: [Type] -> Type where
  Nil' :: NP' '[]
  (:**) :: x -> NP' xs -> NP' ( x ': xs)

-- | example with nested pair
type NestedPair = (Bool, (Char, Int))

nestedPairNP ::NP' '[ Bool, Char, Int ]
nestedPairNP = True :** 'x' :** 3 :** Nil'

-- | we however often need a product
-- f T1 * f T2 ... f Tn

-- | so define NP with functor application built in

-- | we can define n-ary sums

data NS :: (k -> Type) -> [k] -> Type where
  Z :: f x -> NS f ( x ': xs)
  S :: NS f xs -> NS f (x ': xs)

{-
 The constructor Z injects into the first component of a sum (with at least one component)
 S . Z into the second component of a sum with at least 2 components
-}
-- | By nesting NS and NP applications we can define both SOP and POP

type SOP (f :: k -> Type) (xss :: [[k]] ) = NS (NP f) xss

type POP (f :: k -> Type) (xss :: [[k]]) = NP (NP f) xss

  to (S (S _))                           = error "GHC error"

data List a = NilL | ConsL a (List a)

{-
we need to treat NP values as applicatives and for that we need a pure function

 pure :: forall a . f a -> NP (f a) xs

the pure function would create NP for a given element for as many times as xs, this
requires performing induction over xs which subsequently requires using singletons
